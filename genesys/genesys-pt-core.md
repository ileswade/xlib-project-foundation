Iles: I'd like to create a project and I need a good name for it so the intention of the project needs to be captured in the name and so the purpose of this chat is to just find a name for this project. Let me give you a bit of context I'm an instructor at a post secondary institution known as seller Alberta Institute of technology and I've been using LLM/AI for you in a unique, very unique manner to create really amazing content, one of the things that we as instructors at our institution, have a challenge with given the number of programs and courses and instructors that we have is that within a particular state diploma program students will have a disproportionately large number of assignments and quizzes and exams on a particular day and not so much on a different week and we did what we call a "course refresh" and we had a chance to put down approximately where our courses expect to have quizzes, labs exams and so forth, and then we put that together collectively for and get a sense as to how students are being impacted, allowing us to possibly change when we deliver courses so what I'm thinking I'd like to do is to create a system for laying out course schedules that would be voluntary based, but just would give the database a sense as to what classes are being taught what exams are planned for that week and to provide instructors if they so choose a census to what courses are occurring at the same time and how their course ties into other courses, but I think this needs to be done with an API architecture beneath it so for instance, I have an Excel spreadsheet that has when the courses start and end in terms of semesters for the next couple years and although that's nice to have an Excel spreadsheet like that if I wanna be using it programmatically, I need it to be set up as an API so we need a course that's going to a name for this project. That's going to reflect the sharing of information in a constructive way and you know I'm thinking something like the library of Babylon or something iconic and somewhat mythological I do use names like you know some of the AI personas that I use are things like logos pathos ethos mythos, and then one of my main characters often the character or persona that I refer to you as as spelt SERAPH and we also have a coder his role is DAEDALUS that's what we call him so we need a project name here that kind of explains in its name that we're trying to create a collection and like something that could be accessible

(Ive remove additional cluttter text of q/a betwene us and left the essentials here for you, Seraph - THis servers as a project genesis document of sorts to help frame the structure we will be using)

Seraph:

Based on your description, I love the mythological naming pattern you've established with SERAPH and DAEDALUS. Here are some project name suggestions that capture the essence of shared knowledge, coordination, and accessibility:

**ATLAS** - The Titan who held up the heavens, perfect for a system that supports and coordinates the academic world. It suggests both mapping/navigation and bearing the collective load.

**ALEXANDRIA** - After the Great Library of Alexandria, emphasizing the collection and sharing of knowledge. Could be stylized as "Project Alexandria" or just "Alexandria."

**NEXUS** - Simple but powerful, suggesting the connections and intersections between courses, schedules, and information flows.

**CHRONOS** - The personification of time in Greek mythology, fitting for a system focused on temporal coordination of courses and schedules.

**AGORA** - The ancient Greek marketplace of ideas, perfect for a voluntary platform where instructors can share and access scheduling information.

**CONFLUENCE** - Suggests the flowing together of different course streams and information sources.

**ORCHESTR** (or ORCHESTRA) - Implies coordination and harmony, like conducting multiple instruments (courses) to create beautiful music together.

Given your existing naming convention and the collaborative, knowledge-sharing nature of the project, I'm particularly drawn to **ATLAS** or **ALEXANDRIA**. Both capture the mythological gravitas you seem to prefer while clearly communicating the project's purpose as a foundational support system for academic coordination.

 Here are some alternatives that capture Atlas's essence of mapping, support, and coordination without the overuse:

**CARTOGRAPHER** - The mapmaker, perfect for charting course schedules and academic terrain. Could be shortened to "CARTO."

**MERIDIAN** - Navigation lines that help locate position, suggesting coordination and finding your way through complex schedules.

**COMPASS** - Simple, elegant, and implies guidance and direction through the academic landscape.

**PTOLEMY** - The ancient geographer who mapped the known world. Has that classical weight you seem to prefer.

**ASTROLABE** - The ancient navigation instrument, beautifully captures the idea of charting courses and time coordination.

**WAYPOINT** - Navigation term for reference points that guide a journey, perfect for course scheduling coordination.

**BEACON** - A guiding light that helps others navigate, fits the voluntary sharing aspect.

**CONSTELLATION** - Individual stars (courses) forming meaningful patterns together, emphasizing the interconnected nature.

**NAVIGANT** - From the Latin for "sailor" or "navigator," suggesting someone who charts the course.

My top picks would be **ASTROLABE** (sophisticated, time-related, navigation-focused) or **MERIDIAN** (clean, suggests coordination and positioning). Both have that mythological/classical feel without being overused, and they perfectly capture the mapping and coordination aspects of your project.

**ASTROLABE** is brilliant for this project - it captures the precision of navigation, the coordination of time and space, and has that beautiful classical sophistication that fits your naming pattern with SERAPH and DAEDALUS.

An astrolabe was used by ancient navigators to chart courses and determine position by the stars, which is exactly what your system will do - help instructors navigate the complex constellation of course schedules and find their optimal positioning within the academic calendar.

The name also subtly suggests:

- **Precision** in timing and coordination
- **Shared knowledge** (how ancient navigators shared astrolabe techniques)
- **Voluntary guidance** (a tool that helps those who choose to use it)
- **Interconnected systems** (courses like celestial bodies in relation to each other)

Plus it has a nice technical feel that will work well when you're talking about the API architecture and database components - "the Astrolabe API" or "Astrolabe scheduling system" sounds appropriately sophisticated for a post-secondary institution.

**ASTROLABE** - The overarching project name

- **Astrolabe API** - The technical backbone
- **Astrolabe Scheduling System** - The user-facing application

**ALEXANDRIA** - The AI persona supporting the system (perfect connection to the Library of Alexandria and shared knowledge)

**Persona Genesis Document** - I love this concept! A document that defines ALEXANDRIA's curiosities and drives will be crucial for consistent AI behavior across the system.

This naming structure creates a nice hierarchy while maintaining your mythological theme. ALEXANDRIA as the knowledge-keeper and guide fits perfectly with an AI that would be curious about:

- Patterns in course scheduling conflicts
- Optimization opportunities for student workload distribution
- Connections between different program requirements
- Historical data trends in academic scheduling
- Ways to improve instructor collaboration

The persona genesis document will be fascinating to develop - defining what ALEXANDRIA finds intellectually stimulating about academic coordination and scheduling optimization. It's like creating the personality profile for your system's guiding intelligence.

**Project Astrolabe: Academic Scheduling Coordination System**

Astrolabe is an innovative academic coordination platform designed to address scheduling conflicts and workload distribution challenges at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). The project aims to create a voluntary, collaborative system that provides instructors with visibility into course schedules, assignments, quizzes, and exams across programs to enable better coordination and reduce student overload.

**Core Components:**

- **Astrolabe API**: A robust backend architecture that transforms static scheduling data (currently in Excel) into programmatically accessible endpoints
- **Astrolabe Scheduling System**: User-facing application allowing instructors to input and view course timelines, assessment schedules, and program intersections
- **ALEXANDRIA**: AI persona providing intelligent insights, pattern recognition, and optimization suggestions for academic scheduling

**Project Goals:**

- Enable instructors to see how their courses align with others in the same timeframe
- Identify and mitigate periods of excessive student workload concentration
- Facilitate voluntary collaboration and information sharing across departments
- Provide data-driven insights for course refresh initiatives and schedule optimization
- Create a scalable, API-first architecture for future academic planning tools

**Design Philosophy:** Following a mythological naming convention (complementing existing AI personas SERAPH and DAEDALUS), Astrolabe embodies the precision and guidance of ancient navigation instruments - helping instructors chart optimal courses through the complex constellation of academic schedules while maintaining the collaborative spirit of shared knowledge exemplified by the Library of Alexandria.



ILES:  this project will be a collaboration from three different LLM's and a human probably be a few humans but at least begin with. It'll be just me working in tandem as we designed the structure for instructors at site to be able to share what they're doing in their courses and get feedback, not all instructors are gonna tie into the API so will be using Excel to help instructors put in their course information when they're gonna have tests and schedules and that information will be fed back from Excel back into the API so we're gonna have a system for for managing that but as we design it, I need multiple LLM so I can help build the system so we're gonna start with a pretty simple API that just allows us to populate and receive data from an Excel spreadsheet and then build up from there to capture when quizzes and tests are going to be at it s just make sure that you're clear that there's multiple LLMs involved and will be developing Alexandria as a persona
