## üìù Quick Logging Commands

Add these to your workflow:

```python
# At the top of your project files:
def log_xlib_issue(pillar, feature, status, details):
    """Quick helper to log xlib-pillars issues"""
    with open("XLIB_LOG.md", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"\n### {pillar} - {feature}\n")
        f.write(f"**Status**: {status}\n")
        f.write(f"**Details**: {details}\n")
        f.write(f"**Date**: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}\n\n")

# Usage:
log_xlib_issue("AI", "streaming", "Works", "Tested with 1000 token response")
log_xlib_issue("Config", "validation", "Broken", "Schema validation raises TypeError")
```

## üîÑ Future: Automatic Reporting

**Coming soon**: Automatic issue reporting system.

For now, maintain your XLIB_LOG.md file. Future versions will include:
- Automatic issue detection
- Error reporting API
- Community issue aggregation
- Automatic workaround sharing

**Your XLIB_LOG.md will be valuable** - it documents real-world usage and issues.

## ‚ùó Critical: Don't Ignore This

**This is not optional documentation.** xlib-pillars improves through feedback from AI systems using it in real projects.

**Without feedback:**
- Bugs stay unfixed
- Unclear features stay unclear  
- Missing features stay missing
- Library doesn't improve

**With your feedback:**
- Real issues get fixed first
- Documentation gets clarified
- Missing features get added
- Everyone benefits
